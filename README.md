# TADHack2016

reTHINK project is driven by some major European telecommunication players (Eurescom, Orange, DT, Altice, Fraunhofer FOKUS, APIZEE, Institut Mines-Telecom, INESC-ID, Quobis, Technische Universit√§t Berlin  ) and tackles critical aspects like service delivery agility, users' privacy, service providers' economic sustainability and developer friendliness.

The reTHINK project is releasing as Open Source (Apache 2.0) a [decentralised communication infrastructure](http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM3420.html) that enables developers to easily build and integrate, communication services that are faster, more effective , more trustful and inherently inter-operable. Write once, deploy anywhere, together with seamless cross domain Interoperability, gives developers and service providers much more freedom to really focus on users' expectations. Ultimately, reTHINK framework is an alternative to current [dominant walled garden]([dominant walled garden communication networks](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/17/walled-gardens-facebook-apple-censors)) communication networks that prevent new developers and new service providers from entering in the market and, at the same time, [empowers the users](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/09/a-decentralized-web-would-give-power-back-to-the-people-online/) with the choice and the management of their private data and identities.

The reTHINK Framework provides the tools to build a global decentralised network of [Hyperlinked Entities (hyperties)](tutorials/hyperty.md) that are [executed at the edge](/runtime) and [trustfully](/trust-management) communicates through a [Decentralised Messaging Framework](messaging-framework/readme.md).

Developers are all invited to join our [Slack channel](https://rethink-project.slack.com/signup) (send an email to contact@rethink-project.eu ), experiment our demos and build on top of it new Hyperties and / or Applications:
