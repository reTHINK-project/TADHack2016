# TADHack2016

This Repo is dedicated to give support to TADHack participants using reTHINK Framework.

## reTHINK Framework Overview

reTHINK Framework is driven by some major European telecommunication players (Eurescom, Orange, DT, Altice, Fraunhofer FOKUS, APIZEE, Institut Mines-Telecom, INESC-ID, Quobis, Technische Universit√§t Berlin  ) and tackles critical aspects like service delivery agility, users' privacy, service providers' economic sustainability and developer friendliness.

The reTHINK Framework is a [decentralised communication infrastructure](http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM3420.html)(licensed with Apache 2.0) that enables developers to easily build and integrate, communication services that are faster, more effective , more trustful and inherently inter-operable. Write once, deploy anywhere, together with seamless cross domain Interoperability, gives developers and service providers much more freedom to really focus on users' expectations. Ultimately, reTHINK framework is an alternative to current [dominant walled garden]([dominant walled garden communication networks](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/17/walled-gardens-facebook-apple-censors)) communication networks that prevent new developers and new service providers from entering in the market and, at the same time, [empowers the users](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/09/a-decentralized-web-would-give-power-back-to-the-people-online/) with the choice and the management of their private data and identities.

The reTHINK Framework provides the tools to build a global decentralised network of [Hyperlinked Entities (hyperties)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/tutorials/hyperty.md) that are [executed at the edge](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master//runtime) and [trustfully](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master//trust-management) communicates through a [Decentralised Messaging Framework](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/messaging-framework/readme.md).

Developers are all invited to join our [Slack channel](https://rethink-project.slack.com/signup) (send an email to contact@rethink-project.eu ), experiment our demos and build on top of it new Hyperties and / or Applications:
  
*	[Webinars](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xTKj2ZvhUyJosA_fLeAhg)
* [Demos](https://hybroker.rethink.ptinovacao.pt/examples/)
*	[Available Hyperties](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-hyperty)
*	[Quick start to develop Hyperties](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-hyperty-toolkit)
*	[Quick start to develop Applications with Hyperties](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-app)
*	[Tutorials](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/tutorials/readme.md)
*	[Complete Specification](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs)

## Challenges

__Challenge 1__- Interoperability between Apps developed by 2 different teams using existing Hyperties. 

__Challenge 2__- Interoperability between Apps developed by 2 different teams using existing Hyperties and new Hyperties, or existing but extended Hyperties. Example of an extended Hyperty could be
 * Communication object to support emojis or the delete or update of sent messages. 
 * Group chat bot with some AI.

It is encouraged to use resources from other sponsors to Applications thematic, for example chat and audio/video customer care for carrefour working on different domains and hyperties. Monitoring applications can be designed (video, sensors, etc..).

## Survey

In order to improve reTHINK framework, all TADHack participants using reTHINK framework are kindly requested to provide feedback:
